# Weather Prediction Model

This project involves developing a weather prediction model using a dataset containing various meteorological parameters. The model leverages historical weather data to forecast future conditions. The dataset includes attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, and more, recorded at different atmospheric levels.

The dataset consists of records with the following fields: date, year, month, day, hour, day of the week, day of the week name, and whether the day is a weekend. It also includes several meteorological measurements: temperature corrected for 2m elevation, temperatures at 850mb and 500mb pressure levels, total precipitation, relative humidity at 2m, snowfall amount, wind speed and direction at 10m, 850mb, and 500mb, total cloud cover, high, medium, and low cloud cover, shortwave and longwave radiation, mean sea level pressure, geopotential height at 500mb, general temperature, and soil temperature at 0-7cm depth.

The primary goal of this project is to create an accurate predictive model that can forecast various weather parameters based on the historical data provided. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the model aims to predict future weather conditions with a high degree of accuracy.

## Methodology
The process involves several key steps:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure suitability for model training. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
* **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to accurate weather prediction.
* **Model Training:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms to train the model. 
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of different models using metrics like mean squared error, accuracy, and others. The best-performing model is selected based on these evaluations.
